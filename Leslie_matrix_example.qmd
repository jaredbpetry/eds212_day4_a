### Leslie Matrix Example 

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}
insect_leslie <- matrix(data = c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), 
                        nrow = 3, 
                        ncol = 3, 
                        byrow = TRUE)

#----good practice to hit enter after a comma so that the function is vertically spaced

insect_leslie


```

Now create initial condition variables

```{r}
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```

```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0
insect_y1
```

```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1
insect_y2
```

```{r}
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2
insect_y3
```
